In the code you've provided, the ideas array is a member of the Brain class, which means that it is dynamically allocated on the heap when an instance of the class is created. Since this array is a part of the class, it will be deallocated automatically when the class instance is destroyed.

In C++, when an object is destroyed, its destructor is called, and any dynamically allocated memory that is owned by the object is automatically deallocated. In the case of your Brain class, the destructor is automatically called when an instance of the class is destroyed, so you don't need to explicitly deallocate the memory used by the ideas array.

However, if you have used new to create an instance of Brain, and storing the pointer to it, you need to manually delete the pointer after use.

```c++
Brain* brain = new Brain();
// use brain
delete brain;

```
It's good practice to always be aware of the memory management in C++, and to ensure that any dynamically allocated memory is deallocated when it is no longer needed, to avoid memory leaks.
