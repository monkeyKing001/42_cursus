# stringstream class
std::stringstream is a stream class that can operate on strings. It allows you to read and write data from and to a string as if it were a stream like std::cin or std::cout. This can be useful when you want to read from or write to a string in a way that is similar to reading from or writing to a file or other stream.

Here is an example of using std::stringstream to convert an integer to a string and vice versa:

```c++
#include <sstream>
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
	// Convert an integer to a string
	int num = 123;
	std::stringstream ss;
	ss << num;
	std::string str = ss.str();
	std::cout << "str: " << str << std::endl;

	Copy code
	// Convert a string to an integer
	str = "456";
	ss.str(str);
	ss >> num;
	std::cout << "num: " << num << std::endl;

	return 0;
}
```

Output:
str: 123
num: 456
