When you call a function like `c++::swap(a, b)` with the global scope resolution operator `::`, the compiler will look for the function in the global namespace.

If the swap function is declared in a header file called `whatever.hpp`, the compiler will look for it in the global namespace. However, for the compiler to be able to find the function, the header file `whatever.hpp` must be included in the source file where the function is called (in this case, main.cpp).

So, in order to call the swap function declared in `whatever.hpp` in `main.cpp` without any namespace, you need to include the header file in main.cpp and make sure the swap function is declared in the global namespace.

```c++
#include "whatever.hpp"

int main()
{
    int a = 1, b = 2;
    ::swap(a, b);
    // ...
}
```
Alternatively, you could also use an explicit namespace or a using declaration to use the function without the global scope resolution operator.

```c++
#include "whatever.hpp"

int main()
{
    int a = 1, b = 2;
    using namespace whatever;
    swap(a, b);
    // ...
}
```

```c++
#include "whatever.hpp"

int main()
{
    int a = 1, b = 2;
    whatever::swap(a, b);
    // ...
}
```
Keep in mind that the function should be implemented in the same namespace you are trying to access it from.

### generic function
---
A generic function in C++ is a function that can work with different types of data, without the need for explicit type casting or overloading. This is achieved using template functions, which allow you to create a single function that can work with different types of data by specifying a template parameter.

For example, you can create a generic swap function that can swap the values of two variables of any type:
```c++
template <typename T>
void swap(T &a, T &b)
{
    T temp = a;
    a = b;
    b = temp;
}
```
In this example, the template parameter T is used to specify the type of data that the function will work with. The function can be used to swap integers, floats, strings, and any other type of data.

```c++
int a = 1, b = 2;
swap(a, b); // a = 2, b = 1

std::string c = "hello", d = "world";
swap(c, d); // c = "world", d = "hello"
```
When the function is called, the compiler generates a specialized version of the function for the specific type of data being used. This process is called template instantiation.

Summary
1. A generic function in C++ is a function that can work with different types of data.
2. Using template function, you can implemente generic function
3. systax:
```c++
template <typename T>
void swap(T &a, T &b)
{
    T temp = a;
    a = b;
    b = temp;
}
```
4. When the function is called(in compile time), the compile generates the function for the specific type. -template instantiation



In C++, generic functions are powerful tools that can improve code reusability, reduce code duplication, and make the code more readable. However, they can also make the code more complex and harder to understand, so they should be used with caution.

### Template
---
A template in C++ is a way to create a generic function, class or variable that can work with different types of data. The keyword template is used to indicate that a function, class, or variable is a template.

When you see `template<typename T>` in a header file, it's indicating that the function, class, or variable that follows is a template. T is a placeholder for a type (also called a template parameter) that will be provided when the template is instantiated.

Here is an example of a simple template function:

```c++
template <typename T>
void swap(T &a, T &b)
{
    T temp = a;
    a = b;
    b = temp;
}
```
